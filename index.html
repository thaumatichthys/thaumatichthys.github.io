            Hi, my name is Max, and here you can find some of my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, I like playing with microcontrollers and electronics, although I have no formal
            education on the subject that extends past high school physics. Because of this, and my
            lazy nature, some of the content here is particularly low effort.

            Note that the above image is not of me.
