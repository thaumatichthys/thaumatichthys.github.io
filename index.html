            Hi, I'm Max, and here you can find some of my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently doing my undergrad in UBC Engineering.
        </p>

            In general, I like playing with microcontrollers and electronics. I use this site to document some of my projects over the past 
            few years, although some of the pages are unfinished and/or low effort. 
        </p>

            Have a look around! You can click a topic on the top bar.

            Image: Dual resonant solid state tesla coil; basically a high voltage, resonant transformer that can generate sparks.

            The site is written in HTML/CSS/JS, and it is hosted on GitHub pages. (If it is in the URL, then my domain probably expired, XD)
