            Before starting, I should say that all my knowledge is based on reading stuff from the internet, and some high school 
            physics. Thus, there are probably inaccuracies in this article, and don't expect anything in particular to be correct.
            Also, the final results for this coil are very disappointing, simply because I ran out of time before I could test it 
            with the proper capacitor to supply it with power, and thus the arcs I achieved were pathetically small. I do intend to 
            work on it again after I have time though.

            The QCW tesla coil is a further development of the DRSSTC (dual resonant solid state tesla coil). Visually,
            it usually has a shorter and wider secondary coil compared to a regular SSTC or DRSSTC. They also typically 
            make straighter and longer arcs than DRSSTCs. Some QCW coils are known to make sparks over ten times the length 
            of their secondary coil.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some technical characteristics are that they typically have higher coupling than a DRSSTC, with k being usually 
            greater than 0.4-0.5, rather than the 0.2 and 0.3-ish for DRSSTCs and regular SSTCs. In addition, QCW coils often 
            run at relatively high frequencies, usually over 400 kHz. They also usually have lower maximum primary current, 
            which allows for probably the biggest difference: QCW tesla coils run in much longer, ramped pulses of power. Where 
            a DRSSTC might run in 100Âµs pulses, a QCW gradually ramps up its output over 10-20ms. According to forum posts and 
            other internet sources, this ramped power cycle, in combination with a high operating frequency allows the arc to 
            grow much longer than those from a DRSSTC.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Ramping the power
        </h4>
        <p>
            This ramped power cycle is typically achieved in a few different ways. A popular approach is to simply use a 
            (very beefy) buck converter to ramp the inverter supply voltage. This method is relatively simple, and has been
            shown to work very well. A microcontroller controls a large MOSFET or IGBT, which basically PWMs a rectified-mains 
            power supply, and then this is fed into an LC filter that outputs a relatively smooth, variable DC voltage. This 
            can then be used to power the inverter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other method is to phase shift the drive signals for the inverter (this only works for full H bridge inverters).
            Essentially, in a normal full bridge, the left and right halves get signals which are out of phase by 180 degrees,
            but when modulating the power using phase shifting, this 180 degree phase shift can be modulated to vary the power 
            going to the primary LC circuit. An advantage of this over changing the pulse width of each half of the H bridge, 
            according to my understanding, is that it allows half the H bridge to still switch during a current zero crossing, 
            which reduces strain on the transistors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the gif below, the top two lines represent the halves of the H bridge, and the bottom represents the output voltage.
        </p>
        <img src="regular-shift.gif" alt="desmos graph of the phase shifted waveforms">
        <p>
            In this case, the middle line is the one being phase shifted. This half of the H bridge will be "hard switching" (switching 
            not during a current zero crossing), and 
            will heat up much more. This can be a problem, and one method to solve this is to alternate the side that gets phase 
            shifted. In some drivers such as the <a href="https://tqfp.org/simple-tesla/simpledriver-v23-in-english.html#!prettyPhoto" 
            target="_blank">Simpledriver 2.3</a>, the side which gets phase shifted can be set to alternate between every long pulse,
            or between every oscillation cycle. In my driver design, (which is partly based on the Simpledriver), I chose the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a side note, it seems that the Simpledriver's schematic link has gone down, but it can still be found on the wayback
            machine

            This is essentially the same thing as before, but the two top lines are swapped every cycle.

            Implementing the phase shifter
        </h4>
        <p>
            In the Simpledriver, an FPGA + analog approach is used to variably phase shift the input signal. While this method 
            certainly can work well, I thought that an easier way would be to just use the RP2040 microcontroller's PIO unit.
            My reasoning was that an RP2040 is much cheaper than an FPGA that could be used for this ($7.65 CAD for the XC9536, 
            compared to $1.06 for the RP2040). I also thought that it could be more straightforward to design. (Also because I am
            already kind of familiar with the RP2040).
        </p>
        <p>
            The RP2040 has two separate PIO peripherals, each consisting of a shared program memory (which holds a maximum of 32
            instructions), and four state machines which can independantly run the shared program. There are only nine different 
            instructions that the state machines can run, but this is sufficient for what I am doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The phase shift program essentially waits for an input state change, and then sets a counter which increments up to a 
            certain value, which determines the amount of phase shift. After it reaches this value, it switches the output pin state. 
            In addition, each time it counts, it makes sure that the input pin state has not switched a second time before it has 
            finished counting. If it detects this, it immediately switches the output state. This is to ensure that it does not fall 
            out of sync with the input, since that will almost certainly cause the tesla coil to catastrophically fail.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I also made another program to alternate the phase shift pins every cycle in PIO. The RP2040 has two PIO blocks, but I 
            wanted to reserve one of them for the fiber optic IO, to control the driver. So I had two different programs that needed 
            to be run from only one program memory bank.
        </p>
        <p>
            A solution to this problem was to literally just put both programs into the same memory, but to ensure that they each had 
            an unconditional jump to their starting points. The state machines can be set to start their program counters at a certain 
            offset, so different state machines could run these different programs independantly. I did get pretty lucky though, since 
            my two programs just happened to add up to exactly 32 instructions, which perfectly fit in the memory space.

        <p>
            The phase lag program does use quite a few clock cycles each time it counts, so to have a decent resolution, the clock 
            speed should be pretty high. This is fine though, since the RP2040 can be easily overclocked to around 420 MHz.

        <h4>
            The driver
        </h4>
        <p>
            I scratched together a circuit, with some features taken from the Simpledriver, such as the output stage and some of the 
            protection features. The main difference between mine and the SD was that (as mentioned before), mine did not use any analog
            components for the phase shifting.
        </p>
        <img src="qcw2-schematic.png" alt="circuit schematic of the tesla coil driver">
        <p>
            This is the schematic I ended up using. This was the first attempt that I had actually built, and it has a few different 
            issues. Heres the long list of problems I ended up having.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The RP2040 refused to boot. This ended up being caused by a few different issues, the first being the 
                crystal. If you ever design a board with the RP2040, <b>do not use a 100Î© crystal!!!!!!</b>. This probably wasted almost a week 
                of my life, since it would refuse to oscillate with the recommended resistors and loading capacitors. Make sure you use a 50Î© crystal 
                and just avoid the headache!
            </li>            
            <li>Poor soldering of the QFN-56 package of the RP2040.
                I don't really know why I even tried to reflow the thing myself in a walmart toaster oven, but I think I didn't leave the 
                oven on for long enough, and a bunch of the QFN pads were not connected properly. This resulted in me needing to fix numerous 
                problems on the board, so I guess the lesson here is, don't try to reflow QFN parts unless you're confident that you can do it 
                properly. 
            </li>
            <li>The output stage did not have any dead time, so the MOSFETS tended to heat up extremely quickly 
                when switching. A few seconds of switching was enough for the MOSFETS to become too hot to touch. This was not a huge deal 
                though, since the tesla coil operates in pulses less than 30ms long. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The output stage did not damp oscillations between the DC blocking capacitors enough, which actually ended up killing 
                two of my IGBTs. Although this might be more of a GDT leakage inductance issue. 
            </li>
            <li>The MCP6561 comparators come in different variants, some of which are the same package. I thought that the letters on the 
                end were not important, but it turns out that the different variants have different pinouts, so I had to replace some of 
                these ICs on my board. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The UVLO feature never really worked, since it would falsely trigger whenever the output MOSFETS switched. It still 
                didn't really work after changing the firmware, adding decoupling capacitors on top of the comparator, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is not necessarily a problem, but I am not confident that the phase lead really worked. This is partly because 
                I did not have enough time to thoroughly test it, but I guess it is something to note.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            After these problems were addressed though, the board seemed to work fine.

            I used my <a href="/projects/optical-sensor/" target="_blank">diy knockoff version</a> of the IFD-95T fiber optic receiver. It is quite a

        <h4>
            The coils
        </h4>
        <p>
            Before actually doing anything in real life, I ran a quick simulation of the coil in a program called <a 
            href="http://classictesla.com/java/javatc/javatc.html" target="_blank">JavaTC</a>. This helps 
            to ensure that the geometry of the coil actually makes sense, and although the simulation is going to be quite inaccurate,
            it helps to ensure that the coil at least has a chance of working right. 
        </p>
        <img src="javatc-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of a simulation (JavaTC)">
        <h4>
            The secondary coil 
        </h4>
        <p>
            I first started by cutting a 6" length of 3.5" O.D. ABS drain pipe. I then 3D printed some adapters, and hot glued together 
            a little rig to help wind the coil. I used a stepper motor connected to a driver and microcontroller with a potentiometer, 
            all just plugged into a breadboard. 
        </p>
        <img src="coil-winding-thing.jpg" alt="coil winding rig thing">
        <p>
            Winding the coil was relatively quick using the motorized winding thing. I used roughly 200m of 32 AWG wire, resulting in 
            around 750 windings. 
            (Don't mind the messy desk).
        </p>
        <img src="partly-wound.jpg" alt="partly wound secondary coil on the winding rig">
        <p>
            After the coil was wound, I used some epoxy resin to encapsulate the entire coil. I just brushed it onto the coil, and left 
            it to spin overnight. After that, it was solid enough not to move around on its own, so I just left it in the garage for a 
            few days to fully cure. 
        </p>
        <img src="epoxy-coated.jpg" alt="fully wound secondary coil, with epoxy coating on the winding rig">
        <p>
            Lastly, I 3D printed some end caps, and epoxied them on. For the bottom side, I soldered some thicker wire, and encased the 
            joint in epoxy as I glued the rim on. For the top, I made an rhombus-like configuration of bare wire strands, to hopefully 
            interface with the topload. The top cap also has a nylon bolt glued into it to allow the topload to simply screw on. 
        </p>
        <img src="finished-secondary.jpg" alt="completed secondary coil">
        <h4>
            The primary coil
        </h4>
        <p>
            This was relatively simple, I just 3D printed a frame to wind it on, and I just wound 14 turns of 14 AWG wire around it.
        </p>
        <img src="primary-frame.jpg" alt="primary coil frame">
        <h4>
            The topload
        </h4>
        <p>
            The topload essentially helps increase the parasitic capacitance between the top of the secondary coil and the ground, lowering 
            the resonant frequency. In addition, the sparks themselves can cause the resonant frequency to change, since 
            they are essentially an extension of the topload. Having a larger topload helps reduce this effect. In my case, the topload 
            was just a length of aluminum ducting pipe, bent into a circle, and taped together with foil tape. There are also some 3D
            printed circle pieces that screw together to clamp around the toroid, which also contains a nylon nut to screw onto the 
            secondary coil. These 3D printed pieces were then covered in foil tape to make their surfaces conductive.

            Resonant capacitor bank 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Since this is a QCW DRSSTC, it needs a primary capacitor. This should be able to handle a lot of current and voltage, so 
            having just one capacitor would require a very expensive capacitor. A simpler method is to just use a bunch of smaller ones. 
            I ended up using a 10 series, 2 parallel bank of KEMET R76 39nF 2kVDC film capacitors. They seem to have different voltage ratings 
            as a function of frequency, but according to the datasheet, they are "nominally" 700VAC rated. This actually seems to be for a 
            different frequency, but for short durations I think it should be fine. The result is a 7.8nF, 7kVAC MMC.

            I made the board by cutting out the design from a sheet of recycled milk jugs. (You can bake milk jugs in the oven, and

        <p>
            I designed a small PCB for streamlining the build process of the inverter. (The PCBs are cheap from China, but the 
            shipping is expensive... so ordering two or three different boards is basically the same price as ordering one).
            The board is kind of "inspired" by <a href="https://www.loneoceans.com/labs/sales/easybridge/" target="_blank">
            Loneoceans' EasyBridge</a>... (its basically a knockoff of it).

            Heres me pointing to the two IGBTs that died due to the GDT leakage inductance and poor output stage damping... 
            (I only installed four IGBTs, although there can be four more for a double-full-bridge).
        </p>
        <p>
            A "bandaid" solution is to add bidirectional TVS diodes across the gate and emitter of each IGBT.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to use some Chinese branded IGBTs which I got from LCSC. The part number is "XD075H065CX1S3", and it appears to be kind of 
            obscure on the western part of the internet. They are advertised as 650V, 75A IGBTs with 300A max pulse current. I think these ratings are 
            pretty difficult to test, since a lot of tesla coils go over the maximum ratings anyway.

            In addition to the items mentioned above, I also have a small cascaded feedback current transformer, and 
            small board which has a voltage doubler rectifier and some decoupling capacitors. (Those are way too small though).

            The driver is powered by a 95W HP laptop power supply that I got for cheap at a thrift store.

            The Loneoceans website has a lot of <a href="https://www.loneoceans.com/labs/qcw15/#Design" target="_blank">very 
            useful resources</a> for this. Essentially, he concludes that it is optimal for the secondary resonant frequency to be 
            initially greater than that of the primary, but operate the coil at the upper pole frequency. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is something that I don't really understand, but if you have two resonant LC circuits, with the inductors 
            partly coupled, the system will have two resonant frequencies that are different from the individual ones. With regular 
            DRSSTCs, the coupling is quite low so the two resonant poles are relatively similar to the individual ones, but with a 
            QCW, the coupling is much higher, and the pole frequencies are very different from the individuals. 
        </p>

            This can be seen in the simulation here. The blue trace is the current in the secondary coil of the combined system, 
            and the other two traces are the individual currents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loneoceans mentions that his coil will "default" to the lower pole when the primary frequency is lower than the secondary, 
            but in my experience, there is a way around this. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the oscillations are initially started by exciting the primary circuit at a certain pole frequency, when you ramp up the 
            power, it will continue oscillating at the same frequency. This means that for my driver, I can set a gpio to toggle 
            at the upper pole frequency, feed that into the power inverter while setting the phase shift to 10-20% power. This will 
            cause the coil to oscillate at the upper pole (and without the need for ZCS, because of the low power setting), and after that, 
            the gpio toggling can be turned off, and the power can be ramped to 100% for the classical "QCW" spark.

            Audio modulation
        </h4>
        <p>
            In <a href="https://youtu.be/PQ9mhbj66gk" target="_blank">many videos of QCW coils on the internet</a>, they can be heard
            playing different notes. After asking around on some forums, I have concluded that this can be done by basically superimposing 
            an audio waveform on top of the power ramp. 
        </p>

            Here is with audio modulation, and a light bulb as a series resistor to limit current in case something shorts.

            And here is the same conditions but without the light bulb.

            The real shame here is that I ran out of time for testing it before I acquired a large bulk capacitor, so the arcs are 
            really small. I do intend to keep testing it once I have more free time though.

                    This site is about as close to a goldmine as you can get for this kind of stuff, and relevant to this project are his three QCW DRSSTC

                    Some features of the driver were taken from this design, such as the output stage, and the UVLO and other protections. It is also the one 
                    place which I got the ideas of the alternated phase shift, since Loneoceans' QCW 2 did not go into much detail about the phase shifting.
