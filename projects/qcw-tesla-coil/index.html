            A tesla coil is a specialized type of resonant transformer, typically characterized by a cylindrical secondary coil 
            consisting of many windings of fine wire. It is optimized for generating high AC voltages, allowing the production 
            of large electric sparks, produced when the electric field produced by the coil causes the air to break down and ionize,
            allowing the charge to be conducted away through mainly capacitive coupling.

            The original tesla coils made by Nikola Tesla were made possible by spark gaps. The spark gap acted like a switch that 
            would suddenly close once the voltage on a resonant capacitor became sufficiently high, dumping a pulse of energy into 
            the LC tank circuit which was made up by the resonant capacitor and the primary of the tesla coil.

            Later, people would make tesla coils which were switched using vacuum tubes, and later, transistors. These modern tesla 
            coils are called solid state tesla coils.

            Modern tesla coils are typically switched using a type of transistor called the IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor). 
            Compared to regular bipolar transistors, their insulated, MOSFET-like, voltage operated gate is easier to switch than that
            of bipolar transistors. In BJTs, the collector current is usually a multiple of of gate current, with gains of usually 
            around a few tens to hundreds of times. In a tesla coil, the reactive currents can reach hundreds of amps, meaning a BJT would 
            require a lot of current to turn fully on. On the other hand, MOSFETs are sometimes used, but they also have drawbacks. 
            When a MOSFET is turned on, it acts like a resistor. Modern devices can have on resistances of single digit milliohms, 
            which is quite impressive, but since it acts like a resistor, which has a power dissipation function of P = I^2 * R, at high 
            currents, the power loss can still be quite high. IGBTs and BJTs have a slightly more constant voltage drop of a few volts 
            when they are turned on, essentially acting more like a forward biased diode. This means that at low currents, they are 
            usually less efficient than a MOSFET, but at high currents, they become more efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The IGBT combines the relative ease of gate control of a MOSFET with the relatively constant voltage drop of a BJT, making
            them very suitable for use in a tesla coil. Another thing is that MOSFETs usually become very expensive when they are rated 
            for the high voltages that tesla coils operate at.
