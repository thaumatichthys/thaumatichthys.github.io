            A tesla coil is a specialized type of resonant transformer, typically characterized by a cylindrical secondary coil 
            consisting of many windings of fine wire. It is optimized for generating high AC voltages, allowing the production 
            of large electric sparks, produced when the electric field produced by the coil causes the air to break down and ionize,
            allowing the charge to be conducted away through mainly capacitive coupling.

            The original tesla coils made by Nikola Tesla were made possible by spark gaps. The spark gap acted like a switch that 
            would suddenly close once the voltage on a resonant capacitor became sufficiently high, dumping a pulse of energy into 
            the LC tank circuit which was made up by the resonant capacitor and the primary of the tesla coil. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, people would make tesla coils which were switched using vacuum tubes, and later, transistors. These modern tesla 
            coils are called solid state tesla coils.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern tesla coils are typically switched using a type of transistor called the IGBT (insulated gate bipolar transistor). 
            Compared to regular bipolar transistors, their insulated, MOSFET-like, voltage operated gate is easier to switch than that
            of bipolar transistors. In BJTs, the collector current is usually a multiple of of gate current, with gains of usually 
            around a few tens to hundreds of times. In a tesla coil, the reactive currents can reach hundreds of amps, meaning a BJT would 
            require a lot of current to turn fully on. On the other hand, MOSFETs are sometimes used, but they also have drawbacks. 
            When a MOSFET is turned on, it acts like a resistor. Modern devices can have on resistances of single digit milliohms, 
            which is quite impressive, but since it acts like a resistor, which has a power dissipation function of P = I^2 * R, at high 
            currents, the power loss can still be quite high. IGBTs and BJTs have a slightly more constant voltage drop of a few volts 
            when they are turned on, essentially acting more like a forward biased diode. This means that at low currents, they are 
            usually less efficient than a MOSFET, but at high currents, they become more efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The IGBT combines the relative ease of gate control of a MOSFET with the relatively constant voltage drop of a BJT, making
            them very suitable for use in a tesla coil. Another thing is that MOSFETs usually become very expensive when they are rated 
            for the high voltages that tesla coils operate at.

            There are a few different ways that modern tesla coils are constructed. Generally for large tesla coils, they use either 
            a half bridge or a full bridge. 
        </p>
        <p>(insert images)</p>
        <p>
            Half bridges generally consist of fewer transistors, but they can only deliver half the supply voltage to the load. A full 
            bridge uses at least four transistors, but it can deliver the full supply voltage to the load.

            Types of tesla coil
        </h3>
        <!--consider putting this section before the transistor tangent-->
        <h4>
            Single resonant tesla coils (SSTC)
        </h4>
        <p>
            These coils operate with the secondary circuit (and not the primary) in resonance.
        </p>
        <p>
            These tesla coils are generally considered to be simpler to construct and operate, since many popular circuits stemming 
            from the original designs by Steve Ward and others implement self tuning circuits that keep the secondary circuit perfectly 
            in resonance. The primary circuit is not in resonance, and the primary inductance somewhat limits the current to (relatively) 
            low levels. Because of this, sometimes they can be built to operate continuously, "CW". When operated in pulses, typically, 
            the interruption is implemented by simply toggling an enable pin in the IGBT drivers, and random noise is sufficient to 
            cause the circuit to start oscillating. The self tuning circuitry usually uses either an antenna (with appropriate protection),
            or a current transformer around the bottom lead of the secondary coil.

        <h4>
            Dual resonant tesla coils (DRSSTC)
        </h4>
        <p>
            The DRSSTC is a very popular type of tesla coil due to the fact that it can make impressively sized arcs. These are much 
            more difficult to build however, since the primary circuit is also in resonance. Due to this, the primary and secondary circuits need 
            to be carefully built to match eachother's resonant frequencies, requiring much more careful design. In addition, since the 
            primary circuit is in resonance, when in tune, it appears to almost be a dead short circuit. This causes the current to rise 
            extremely quickly, and to extremely high levels. For instance, a small tabletop DRSSTC can have primary currents exceeding 
            100A. This can cause several issues, which all need to be addressed. Firstly, with such high currents, any stray inductance 
            in the inverter can cause high voltage spikes that can kill the transistors if not kept in check. In addition, before, with 
            the SSTC, the transistor drivers can simply be shut down at any time. This is not possible with a DRSSTC. If the transistors 
            transition from fully on to off while there are such high currents flowing through them, they will likely explode. This causes 
            the need for circuitry that synchronises the turn offs with primary current zero crossings. The need for this synchronization 
            means that DRSSTCs rarely use secondary feedback like regular SSTCs, and instead use primary feedback. DRSSTCs typically operate 
            in pulses of around 100 microseconds, and they are basically never directly operated in continuous mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            A popular program for assisting the design of these is JavaTC. It helps calculate the characteristics of a user defined
            tesla coil, and it is extremely useful for the design of anything beyond a regular SSTC. One particular characteristic it shows
            (beyond resonant frequencies and stuff) is the coupling factor (k) of the tesla coil. This is the same coupling factor for 
            regular transformers, and it is essentially a measure of how much the magnetic fields of the secondary and primary overlap.
            This value is typically made to be low in DRSSTCs, usually around 0.2-0.3.

        <h4>
            Quasi-continuous-wave dual resonant tesla coils (QCWDRSSTC)
        </h4>
        <p>
            Despite just saying that these don't exist, there is another type of tesla coil that is both dual resonant, and is operated 
            in longer (although not quite continuous) pulses. The QCWDRSSTC is unique in that it has an unusually high coupling factor,
            usually >0.4. Usually, they also have higher primary inductances, and a shorter and stumpier secondary coil. Operationally,
            it is essentially a DRSSTC but with lower primary current, and most importantly, operated in a long ramp instead of a short 
            pulse.
