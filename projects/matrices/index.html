            This is mostly meant for PHYS 170.
        </p>
        <p>
            When given a problem with 2D or 3D vectors, in a statics question, this often means that the forces will add up to a net zero.
            (insert q9 as an example)
            Fb, Fc, Fd, and Fa will add up to equal zero.
            In this case, since the positions of all the vectors are known, all of their unit vectors will also be known.
            In this case, we need to use the unit vectors instead of just the vector components, since these components are of length of the cables, 
            and not the actual force components.

        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, the unit vector is just a vector of magnitude 1, with the same direction as the vector it represents.
            We will use these to obtain the ratios between all of the vector components.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can set up the equations as such:
        </p>
<p class="codebox">Fbx + Fcx + Fdx = Fax
Fby + Fcy + Fdy = Fay
Fbz + Fcz + Fdz = Faz
</p>
        <p>
            where Fbx, Fcx, Fdx, etc are the unit vector components of all the cable vectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            This, as written, can be imagined as a 4x3 "augmented" matrix. This can then be plugged into a matrix calculator, and solved via the RREF function.
            (I won't go into how to solve it manually, since I don't know how.)

            What this is doing, is that it is
