            As you might know, inductors are quite useful. In short, an inductor ensures that the derivative of the current running through it
            is proportional to the voltage across it, with the formula V = LdI/dt. In practice, they are often used for filtering
            purposes, being part of transformers, and resonant applications.

            A typical multimeter will be able to measure voltage, current, resistance, and some other, and some meters can also measure capacitance.
            While many multimeters are able to measure inductance, these can be more expensive.

            Either way, these meters typically work by running an alternating current through the inductor, measuring the impedance, and then comparing
            that to the DC resistance. The inductance can then be calculated by the formula X = 2*pi*f*L.

            While this is straightforward for a multimeter to do, this method is sort of finicky to do using something like a microcontroller. Firstly, 
            an accurate and clean AC sine wave must be generated, and then it must be accurately measured to obtain an accurate reading. While this is 
            definitely doable, in my opinion it is not the easiest method.

            An inductor combined with a capacitor forms an LC tank circuit that will oscillate when excited by its resonant frequency, equal to
            f = 1/(2*pi*sqrt(L*C)). Thus, if the capacitance and resonant frequency is known, the inductance can be calculated.
