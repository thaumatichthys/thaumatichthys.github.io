                    Theres this game that has these tank battle. In these matches, in some modes, you will need to
                    figure out the distance between you and whatever you are shooting at. Normally you would do this
                    just by staring at it,
                    but this can be tedious if you are not experienced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A feature to note about these tank battles, is that the game has a minimap on the bottom right of
                    the screen, which displays
                    the entire game map. In addition to this, you can set a key bind, that when activated, places a
                    temporary marker
                    on the minimap at the location you are pointing to. This is typically used for telling your teamates
                    where an enemy is, but
                    it coincidentally has a special colour which is not used anywhere else on the minimap. This,
                    combined with the other marker
                    on the map which indicates where your vehicle is, makes it possible to use some computer vision to
                    calculate the exact distance
                    between you and the enemy.
                </p>

                    This program aims to streamline that process to the extent where it no longer requires additional
                    mouse movements or keyboard
                    actions beyond a single key press. Then, just simply look over to the application window, and the
                    precise distance will automatically
                    be presented.
                </p>
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    Using auto mode:
                    Click the switch that says auto mode, and select the game window. Adjust the three sliders until the
                    view port is <b>exactly</b>
                    laid over game minimap. Change the number of grid squares and distance per grid square parameters
                    to match that of the minimap.
                    When you see an enemy, press the key bind to mark targets for squad, and the distance should be
                    presented on the calculator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do not want to use the automatic screen reading mode or you do not have a compatible browser,
                    you can also just click twice on
                    the map, once for where you are, and again for where the enemy is, and it will then calculate the
                    range in the same way. In addition,
                    if you do not have two monitors to see the results, turn on the text to speech, and it will read it
                    out to you.
