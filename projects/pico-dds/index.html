        Direct Digital Synthesis with RP2040

            Direct digital synthesis is a method to generate analog waveforms of relatively accurate 
            frequency. It has the benefit of being mostly digital, allowing relative freedom for the frequency and types
            of waveforms that we can generate.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are numerous ICs that are designed to do this, and I am aware that this is not really a task best suited for microcontrollers,
            but in small quantities, many of these DDS ICs are more expensive than even relatively fast microcontrollers such as the RP2040.

        <h4>
            Implementing a DDS
        </h4>
        <p>
            Analog Devices has a nice 
            <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/resources/analog-dialogue/articles/all-about-direct-digital-synthesis.html" target="_blank">article</a>
            about what DDS is how it works, and (probably to sell their own DDS chips), the benefits it has over other methods. 
        </p>
        <p>
            They also include this diagram, among others.

            From this, we can see the main parts of the DDS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now in RP2040 terms: 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first three are pretty straightforward.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tuning word and phase register can be either in RAM or some register.</li>
            <li>Phase to amplitude converter can just be a lookup table in RAM or flash.</li>
            <li>D/A converter can be implemented using a resistor ladder and PIO, which can be fed by a DMA channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The phase accumulator is somewhat more tricky. Ideally, this should run very fast, on the order of a few clock cycles, 
            and ideally need to perform a 32 bit add accumulate. Somewhere around this I decided that I didn't want to use the CPU for some reason, 
            so that leaves few options for the addition operation. The PIOs were the first to come to mind, but they really can't do much 
            math at all. I have seen some other people using the hardware interpolators, but those are tied to the CPUs, so those were also 
            not an option. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One feature that seems quite rarely used is the DMA's checksum calculator. These can perform a set of basic operations each clock cycle, and 
            one of these included the basic add accumulate, which was perfect for this purpose. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a DMA channel (I will call it DMA0) read the 32 bit tuning word from RAM into a dummy location, and with the CRC sniffer enabled, this results in the tuning word being 
            accumulated in the SNIFF_DATA register. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage, if having a sawtooth wave is satisfactory, then you can just have DMA0 chain to another channel, DMA1, that reads from SNIFF_DATA, and 
            writes it to the PIO TX fifo with a DREQ, and chain DMA1 back to trigger DMA0. This is relatively simple, and is perfectly fine for generating 
            sawtooth waves. Keep in mind that these are 32 bit values, and you will probably need to truncate them to for them to be more useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I sort of wanted a sine wave, and that requires a lookup table. This ended up requiring another two DMA channels. 
            In this configuration, DMA1 does not write to the PIO, but rather takes the most significant byte of the SNIFF_DATA register, and copies it to the 
            least significant byte of a 32 bit variable (in RAM) that is a pointer to a 256 element, 8 bit, 256 byte aligned lookup table. This has the implication 
            that it avoids needing another addition operation, to add the SNIFF_DATA value to the LUT base address. DMA1 then triggers another, DMA2.
        </p>
        <p>
            (if you were wondering if you could skip out on using DMA2, editing the LUT address directly in DMA3's read address register, that doesn't 
            seem to work; it overwrites more than just the LSB)
        </p>
        <p>
            DMA2 simply copies the 32 bit address variable into the read address of DMA3, triggering it in the process. DMA3 then retriggers DMA0 when it finishes,
            completing the cycle.
        </p>

            Heres some of the code to do this. 
        </p>

/*
    The following happens every time the PIO DREQ's from the DMA.

    The basic idea: Use the DMA's CRC sniffer in accumulate mode as the phase 
    accumulator. Then use this with a lookup table to synthesize an accurate 
    frequency.


        Preload lut_address high bytes with the address of lut[0]
        DMA0: sniffer enabled, copy increment to dummy, trigger DMA1
        DMA1: copy SNIFF_DATA(high byte only) to address(low byte), trigger DMA2
        DMA2: copy address into DMA3 read address, trigger DMA3
        DMA3: copy into PIO, retrigger DMA0

    
    The PIO implementation is very crude and may break when not using PIO0 SM0. 
    Please ensure it works in your application before using.

    wiring:

    connect a resistor ladder DAC circuit to GPIO 0-8, with 8 being the MSB.

            This system uses a 256 long, 8 bit LUT for storing the waveforms, using a 32 bit phase register truncated down to 8 bits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The convoluted, 4 DMA chain takes quite a bit of time to run. The PIO clock divider has to be 9 or greater, and the PIO
            itself further divides the frequency in half. In the end, the effective DDS sample rate is the system clock divided 
            by 18.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a system clock of 125 MHz, the sample rate is only about 6.9 MHz, which is rather low, resulting in crappy waveforms at higher frequencies.
            However, at the 32 bit phase register in theory allows a frequency accuracy of 0.0016 Hz, which makes it extremely good at ensuring that the actual 
            frequency is very accurate. At low frequencies, the waveform is a very clean sine wave.
        </p>
        <img src="scope-traces.jpg" alt="sine wave on oscilloscope">
        <p>
            (The distortion in the middle is due to the fact that my R/2R DAC isn't actually R and 2R, since I used 150Ω and 330Ω resistors, and I only connected
            like 5 of the 8 bits available).
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, this DDS can generate frequencies up to a few MHz with 0.0016 Hz resolution, and is quite good at low frequencies. It is completely
            independant of the CPU when running, and only uses it to set up.
            It certainly has room for improvement, especially in terms of sample rate, and in the future, I might try just using one of the CPU cores to speed things up.
